		<h2>About ProtonMail</h2>
		<p>
			<b> ProtonMail</b>
			was developed in 2013, at least in part due to the
			revelations that Edward Snowden provided regarding the NSA's
			world-wide surveillance (WWS) program. It was developed by
			researchers from CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. If you are not
			familiar with CERN, it's the world's largest subatomic research
			facility that many credit with
			<a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hitchhikers-guide-internet-brief-history-net-came-be-0134490/"
				target="_blank">the development of the World Wide Web</a>
			, among other things.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b> ProtonMail</b>
			was designed to give the email user complete
			anonymity. To accomplish this anonymity, it provides the
			following.
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a
					href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-cryptography-basics-for-aspiring-hacker-0161246/">
					End-to-end encryption
				</a>
				(emails are decrypted in your browser).
			</li>
			<li>
				Does not require a phone number or another email to open an account (that account might be used to track
				your identity).
			</li>
			<li>You can set your email to expire after a number of daysâ€”even hours. It keeps no logs.</li>
			<li>Even the administrators at ProtonMail can't read your email.</li>
			<li>It is located in a neutral nation that is known for its respect for privacy.</li>
		</ul>
		<b> ProtonMail </b> has become very popular because of these unique security features. Presently, there are over
		250,000
		users worldwide and growing rapidly. Due to this rapid growth, you may have to wait awhile to get an account.
		You need to first request an account and, when they have the capacity, they will email you back telling you that
		you are eligible to open an account. Presently, this takes 2-3 weeks, but it does vary.

			<!-- I could use the 'dl' -> 'dt' -> 'dd' tags so I indent the paragraphs but I am not sure if it is semantically correct -->
			<h2>Step 1: Apply for a ProtonMail Account</h2>
			<p>
				The first step, of course, is to request for an account. Go to protonmail.ch and submit a request for an
				account.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article title="Step 2" id="step2">
			<h2>Step 2: Create an Account</h2>
			<p>
				Once you receive the email notifying you that you can now open an account, click on the link they sent
				you. This will take you to a "Create Your Account" screen, such as below.
			</p>

		<article title="Step 3" id="step3">
			<h2>Step 3: Log In</h2>

			<p>
				Once you have created an account, you can log in like any other webmail account.
			</p>

			<img src="./images/login.jpg" alt="Log In" width="100%">

			<p>
				Now that you have successfully logged in with your username and password, ProtonMail will prompt you for
				your second password which is used to decrypt your email.
			</p>

			<img src="./images/decryptMailbox.jpg" alt="Dectrypt Mailbox" width="100%">

			<p>
				When you enter it, it begins working on decrypting your email as seen below.
			</p>

			<img src="./images/decrypting.jpg" alt="Dectrypting Mailbox" width="100%">

			<p>When all of your email is decrypted, it will open a familiar email interface.</p>

			<h2>Step 4: Security Settings</h2>

			<p>
				If you click on "Settings" in the top bar and then "Security," it brings you to the screen below. Notice
				that you can export your PublicKey for use in PGP-compatible services. Presently, it is only compatible
				with OpenPGP. Also notice in the lower half of the screen the "Authentication Logs." By default, they
				are "Disabled" and I recommend you keep them so for the highest level of security.
			</p>

		<article title="Step 5" id="step5">
			<h2>Step 5: Email Expiration</h2>

			<p>
				One of the features of ProtonMail that I really like is the email expiration feature. When you compose
				an email, you can choose how long it will exist on the server before "expiring."
			</p>

			<p>
				To do so, simply click on the "clock" icon in the bottom of the compose email window and it will open a
				slider where you can choose how long the email will exist. In this case, I set the expiration to 13
				hours. After you hit "Set," the clock will begin ticking, and when the time has expired, the email will
				expire and no longer be available to ANYONE.
